**POC 可用性:** 是

**投毒风险:** 10%

## 详情

The provided README.md describes a critical account takeover vulnerability in SecureVPN (CVE-2025-412026). The vulnerability resides in the `/api/v1/authenticate` endpoint, where the API fails to properly validate user credentials. An attacker can intercept a valid session token and use it to authenticate as another user without needing their actual username or password. 

**有效性:**
The provided PoC code appears effective. It demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by sending a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with an intercepted session token.

**投毒风险:**
Based on the provided README.md, the presence of a section detailing usage policy and legal requirements related to linking back to `https://www.geldgift.com/legal?id=` raises concerns about potential SEO poisoning or malicious redirection attempts, even though it appears unrelated to the exploit itself. The risk associated with the usage policy itself constitutes the primary potential for 'poisoning'. Therefore, a 10% chance has been allocated to this file containing 'poison'.

**利用方式:**
The vulnerability is exploited by intercepting a valid session token, then sending a POST request to `/api/v1/authenticate` with the intercepted token in the `Authorization` header. The `username` in the data section of the POST request is irrelevant, as the API only validates the session token. Successfully exploiting the vulnerability results in the attacker gaining full access to the 'victim' user's account.
