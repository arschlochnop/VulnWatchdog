## 详情

The provided POC code consists of a Dockerfile, a Procfile, a README.md file, and an index.js file. The Dockerfile sets up a Node.js environment. The index.js appears to be the main application file, using Express.js to create a web server. While the code itself doesn't directly reveal a specific vulnerability or exploit related to CVE-2016-15042, the README.md file references the CVE within image links. This suggests that the code intends to demonstrate or exploit a vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-15042. However, the image links in the README.md are malformed and point back to the same zip file. Further analysis of the index.js file is needed to determine the exact nature of the vulnerability being demonstrated.

To understand the potential exploit, one would need to analyze the `index.js` file for potential SSRF vulnerabilities since the name suggests it. SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) vulnerabilities occur when a web application allows an attacker to make arbitrary HTTP requests from the server itself. This can be exploited to access internal resources or interact with other systems on the internal network.

To test the POC, the following steps would be needed:

1.  Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
2.  Run the Docker container, exposing port 6892.
3.  Analyze the `index.js` file to identify potential SSRF attack vectors.
4.  Craft HTTP requests to exploit the identified SSRF vulnerabilities.
5.  Verify that the server is making requests to internal resources or external URLs under the attacker's control.

Based on the analysis of the code, the code is relatively simple and does not contain any obvious malicious code or attempts to deliver a payload. The application uses standard node modules and does not attempt to load external scripts or execute commands. Therefore the poisoning risk is low. The image links in the `README.md` are malformed, pointing back to the same zip file. Further, the README file references the CVE-2016-15042, so it is likely that this is a demonstration of some sort. Given the node.js code includes express, it's possible there is an SSRF vulnerability present, which would explain the CVE name.

**投毒风险分析:**
由于代码主要由Dockerfile, Procfile, README.md和index.js组成，没有发现明显的恶意代码，代码清晰，使用了标准的Node.js库，也没有尝试加载外部脚本或者执行命令，因此投毒风险较低。代码没有进行混淆处理，也没有发现任何可疑的请求或`eval`函数的使用。

总而言之，投毒风险评估为0%。
