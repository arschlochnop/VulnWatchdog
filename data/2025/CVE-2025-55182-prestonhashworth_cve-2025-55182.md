## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js applications. This vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of incoming Flight requests in React's Server Functions protocol. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a specially crafted payload to a vulnerable RSC "Server Function" endpoint, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server. The provided POC includes cURL examples that demonstrate file system access, remote code execution, and VM code execution. The file system access test attempts to read the /etc/passwd file. The remote code execution test executes the "whoami" command. The VM code execution test executes "1+1" within a vm context. These tests confirm the vulnerability's capability to perform arbitrary actions on the server. The POC also includes a Postman collection and a service policy for F5 Distributed Cloud, aiding in both testing and mitigation. The service policy leverages regex matching against the request body to identify and block potentially malicious payloads containing terms like "child_process", "execSync", "spawnSync", "readFileSync", "runInThisContext", and "constructor".

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker crafts a POST request to a vulnerable RSC Server Function endpoint. The request body contains a serialized payload designed to trigger the unsafe deserialization. The attacker can leverage known JavaScript methods like `child_process.execSync` or `vm.runInThisContext` to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The provided cURL examples showcase how to construct these malicious payloads using the `--form` parameter to send the necessary data to the endpoint.

The投毒风险分析: The provided POC code is relatively clean and focuses on demonstrating the vulnerability. However, the use of `child_process.execSync` and `vm.runInThisContext` within the exploit carries a moderate risk of code poisoning. An attacker could potentially modify these commands to download and execute malicious scripts from external sources, or inject malicious code into the application's runtime environment. The service policy included in the POC attempts to mitigate this risk by blocking requests containing suspicious keywords, but this approach is not foolproof and could be bypassed with obfuscation or alternative execution methods. The prototype chain access test also increases the poisoning risk because it could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if successful. Overall, the risk is assessed at 30% because the code is generally clear and avoids directly embedding malicious payloads, but the potential for command execution introduces a possibility of further exploitation.
