## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components (RSC) within React versions 19.0.0 to 19.2.0 and Next.js applications. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The provided Proof-of-Concept (POC) code is a Go-based interactive RCE exploitation tool. 

POC有效性分析: The POC code provides an interactive shell that allows the user to execute commands on the vulnerable server. The tool automatically detects the vulnerability and extracts command output in real-time. The README provides clear instructions for building and using the tool, including prerequisites and basic usage examples. The provided demo showcases the tool's functionality, further validating its effectiveness. The tool targets React Server Components, which are designed to execute code on the server-side. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of client requests, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary code. Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the server, enabling them to perform various malicious activities, such as data theft, system modification, or denial-of-service attacks.

利用步骤:
1. Clone the POC code from the provided GitHub repository.
2. Ensure Go 1.18 or higher is installed.
3. Build the exploit using the command: `go build -o CVE-2025-55182 main.go`.
4. Run the exploit with the target URL: `./CVE-2025-55182`. 
5. The tool detects the vulnerability and provides an interactive shell.
6. Execute commands using the shell interface (e.g., `id`, `whoami`, `cat /etc/passwd`).
7. Exit the shell using the `exit` command.

投毒风险分析: The POC code is relatively clean and uses standard Go libraries. However, any RCE exploit carries inherent risks.  The risk lies primarily in the potential for malicious actors to modify and redistribute the exploit with added payloads or backdoors. Given the high severity and ease of use, this exploit is likely to be widely adopted by attackers, increasing the probability of malicious modifications. The code itself does not appear to contain obfuscation or external script dependencies, lowering the risk, but the potential for repackaging necessitates caution. The risk is evaluated at 10% due to the clarity of the code and the absence of suspicious functionality, but the context of RCE exploitation elevates the concern.
