## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components, particularly within Next.js applications. The vulnerability stems from improper handling of client-initiated requests to server-side functions. React Server Functions, designed to allow clients to trigger server-side code execution, inadvertently expose a pathway for attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server. The framework's process of converting client requests into HTTP requests and forwarding them to the server lacks sufficient sanitization and validation, leading to the vulnerability.

The provided POC code consists of a bash script (`scanner.sh`) designed to detect and exploit this vulnerability. The script takes a target domain or URL as input and optionally a command to execute. It utilizes `curl` to send a crafted HTTP request to the target, exploiting the vulnerability. The script can also read targets from a file, execute commands, perform safe checks, and save results to a JSON file. The `README.md` file provides detailed instructions on how to use the scanner, including examples of scanning a target, getting system information, and listing files. The POC's effectiveness has been confirmed through several online reports and vulnerability analyses, indicating that it successfully exploits the RCE vulnerability in vulnerable React/Next.js applications. The POC script provided effectively automates the exploitation process, making it easy for attackers to identify and compromise vulnerable systems. The script provides options for executing arbitrary commands, retrieving sensitive information, or potentially taking complete control of the server. 

The main threat is unauthorized remote code execution, allowing attackers to compromise the server and potentially gain access to sensitive data or disrupt services. The provided scanner.sh script appears well-written, but has some potential for poisoning. While the core logic is direct and utilizes standard tools like `curl` and `openssl`, there is a WAF bypass option, which could be abused to inject malicious code into the request if the bypass method involves something other than simple encoding. There is a reference to a nuclei template, which means that the attacker might attempt to include external requests to fetch additional payloads/commands to be executed on the target.
