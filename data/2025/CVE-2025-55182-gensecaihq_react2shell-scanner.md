## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components and Next.js. The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of user input, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The provided POC, react2shell-guard, is a security scanner designed to detect this vulnerability rather than exploit it directly. However, the existence of the scanner and references to an original PoC by Lachlan Davidson (react2shell.com) indicate that a functional exploit exists and has been demonstrated. 

POC有效性分析:
The react2shell-guard project provides several methods for identifying the vulnerability, including scanning local projects, live URLs, container images, and verifying patches. It also offers auto-fix capabilities and can generate fix PRs for GitHub repositories. The presence of these features suggests that the underlying vulnerability is well-understood and exploitable in various contexts. The "Quick Start" section of the README provides examples of how to use the tool to scan projects, URLs, and container images. This ease of use further indicates a high degree of POC maturity. While react2shell-guard itself is not an exploit, its ability to automatically identify and, to some extent, remediate the vulnerability confirms its practical relevance and the existence of working exploits. The scanner likely leverages specific characteristics of the vulnerable deserialization process to identify affected components. The original PoC referenced, developed by Lachlan Davidson, provides further evidence of the vulnerability's exploitability and is cited as the foundation for the scanner.

利用步骤:
The general exploitation process involves sending a specially crafted payload to a vulnerable React Server Function endpoint. This payload leverages the unsafe deserialization vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server. While the exact format of the payload is not explicitly specified in the available information, it would likely involve manipulating serialized data in a way that causes the server to execute malicious commands when deserialized. Given the unauthenticated nature of the vulnerability, an attacker would simply need to identify a vulnerable endpoint and send the malicious payload. The react2shell-guard tool helps identify these endpoints, but an attacker could also manually discover them by analyzing the application's code or network traffic.

投毒风险分析:
While the provided react2shell-guard POC is primarily a security scanner, the project is not entirely risk-free. The risk of supply chain attacks and malicious contributions always exists with open-source projects. A malicious actor could potentially introduce code that subtly alters the scanner's behavior or adds backdoor functionality. The likelihood of such an event is low given that the scanner's main purpose is to check for vulnerabilities, not exploit them. The code is relatively clear and uses standard libraries. Also, the project actively seeks community contributions, increasing the number of eyes on the code. The auto-fix functionality, while helpful, also poses a slight risk if a malicious contributor were to introduce flawed or harmful fixes. Therefore, using the automated fixes requires caution. Overall, the risk of react2shell-guard being used for malicious purposes is relatively low (estimated at 15%), but users should still exercise caution and carefully review any changes made to their code by the tool.
