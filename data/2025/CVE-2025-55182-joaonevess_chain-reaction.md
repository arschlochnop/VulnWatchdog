## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. The provided POC code, named 'Chain Reaction', is a high-performance Rust scanner designed to detect this vulnerability. It features a mutation engine capable of generating deep, recursive object graphs to bypass WAF configurations and filter rules. The scanner confirms vulnerabilities with zero false positives through a multi-stage verification process, including reflected execution, file system disclosure, and side-channel analysis, as well as blind exploitation support using Out-of-Band interactions.

POC有效性分析:
The POC code is written in Rust and provides both standard scanning and fuzzing modes. The standard scan automatically attempts standard payloads and non-intrusive checks. The fuzzing mode activates the mutation engine to generate unique, deeply nested payloads, making it effective against hardened targets. The POC includes features such as high-performance architecture, advanced evasion techniques, and comprehensive detection methods. The README file provides clear instructions on installation and usage, and the code appears well-structured and maintainable.

利用步骤:
1. Install Rust.
2. Clone the Chain Reaction repository: `git clone https://github.com/joaonevess/chain-reaction.git`.
3. Navigate to the directory: `cd chain-reaction`.
4. Build the project in release mode: `cargo build --release`.
5. Run the scanner against a target URL: `chain-reaction -u https://target.com` (for standard scan) or `chain-reaction -u https://target.com --fuzz` (for fuzzing mode).
6. The scanner will attempt to exploit the vulnerability and report if successful. It confirms the vulnerability with multi-stage verification process.

投毒风险分析:
While the primary purpose of the provided code is to detect and exploit a security vulnerability, there are inherent risks associated with its usage. The Chain Reaction tool's ability to generate deeply nested payloads and bypass security appliances could be repurposed for malicious activities beyond the scope of vulnerability detection. The tool utilizes reqwest crate for making HTTP requests, which is a standard and safe library. The colored crate is used for adding colors to the output, which poses a very low risk. The rand crate is used for generating random values, and async-trait crate is used for asynchronous operations, both of which pose minimal risk. However, the mutation engine's capability to generate complex payloads introduces a moderate risk. While the code itself does not appear to contain overtly malicious functionality, the dynamic nature of payload generation and the potential for customized exploitation scripts could lead to unintended consequences or misuse. Users should exercise caution and carefully review the tool's configuration and usage parameters to minimize the risk of accidental system compromise or unauthorized access. The overall poisoning risk is estimated to be around 35% due to the complexity of the payload generation and the potential for misuse, but absence of overtly malicious code.
