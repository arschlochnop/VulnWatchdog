## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability affecting React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js. The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of payloads sent to Server Function endpoints via the Flight Protocol. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted payload to a vulnerable RSC endpoint, leading to remote code execution. The POC code provided demonstrates a full exploit, enabling remote command execution and output retrieval in an interactive shell-like environment. The core idea behind the exploit involves prototype pollution leading to RCE. The payload uses `$@` and `"then": "$1:__proto__:then"` to pollute the `Chunk.prototype`'s `then` property. Setting the `status` to `resolved_model` triggers the invocation of `initializeModelChunk`, which processes a controlled `_response` object. The attacker can then pollute `_formData.get` by setting it to the JavaScript `Function` constructor (`$1:constructor:constructor`). Finally, a malicious payload in `_prefix` is executed synchronously via `process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync()`. The command's output is wrapped within a `NEXT_REDIRECT` exception and returned to the client. The provided Python script automates this process, making exploitation relatively straightforward. To use the exploit, the attacker only needs to provide the target URL and can then execute arbitrary commands on the server. The vulnerability affects React Server Components versions 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0, including the following packages: react-server-dom-parcel, react-server-dom-turbopack, and react-server-dom-webpack. Next.js versions affected include all stable 15.x versions and 16.x versions prior to 16.0.7.

The投毒风险 is low due to the explicit warning provided within the README.md file accompanying the POC code, emphasizing the educational purpose and ethical limitations of its use. The code itself appears to be clean and well-documented, primarily utilizing standard Python libraries like 'requests' for network communication and not employing any obfuscation techniques or calls to potentially malicious external resources or scripts. The primary function of the code is to send crafted HTTP requests and parse the responses, with the executed commands being explicitly defined by the user during interaction, thereby minimizing the risk of covert malicious activities. The commands executed are also isolated within the context of `child_process.execSync`, limiting their impact on the broader system. Furthermore, the POC focuses on exploiting a known vulnerability for demonstration purposes rather than injecting persistent backdoors or deploying malicious payloads. Therefore, the overall risk of the POC being misused for widespread malicious activity through supply chain poisoning or similar methods is low. The risk could be potentially elevated if threat actors incorporate the exploit into automated attack tools or integrate it into compromised software packages, but this is dependent on external factors rather than inherent maliciousness within the POC itself.
