## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React applications utilizing React Server Components (RSC) or React Server Functions. The vulnerability stems from improper handling of client requests by the server when invoking server-side functions. An attacker can exploit this by crafting malicious HTTP requests that, when processed by the server, lead to arbitrary code execution. 

POC有效性分析：
Based on the provided information and POC code, the exploit likely targets the mechanism by which React Server Components handle client-side function calls. The provided dockerfile builds a next.js application which is vulnerable. The package.json shows it uses react 19.0.0 and next.js 16.0.0. The affected versions could be broader. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution. The provided POC includes a basic Next.js application setup, suggesting a relatively straightforward exploitation process. The presence of a Dockerfile indicates ease of deployment and testing. The javascript files define two pages. The first page contains a link to the second page. The second page fetches data from an external source. The vulnerability lies in how the react server functions handle the requests and processes them. More complex payloads may involve manipulating the request parameters to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

利用步骤：
1. Deploy the vulnerable React application (using the provided Dockerfile or similar setup).
2. Identify the endpoint(s) responsible for handling React Server Function calls.
3. Craft a malicious HTTP request targeting the identified endpoint. This request should include a payload designed to execute arbitrary code on the server. This might involve injecting commands into function parameters or exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities.
4. Send the crafted request to the server.
5. If successful, the attacker will achieve remote code execution, gaining control over the server.

投毒风险分析：
The provided POC code itself appears relatively benign. However, the potential for creating poisoned dependencies or malicious extensions based on this vulnerability is significant. 
1. Malicious Packages: An attacker could create a seemingly harmless React component or utility package that, when included in a project, injects malicious code into the React Server Function handling mechanism, enabling RCE.
2. Dependency Confusion: An attacker could upload a package with a similar name to a popular internal package, tricking developers into using the malicious package instead of the legitimate one.
3. Supply Chain Attacks: Compromising a popular React library or tool and injecting malicious code into its updates could affect a large number of applications.
4. The risk level is further compounded by the high CVSS score (10.0), indicating the critical nature of the vulnerability. The relatively simple POC and the potential for widespread impact make this a high-priority vulnerability to address.
The poisoning risk is estimated at 20% because the current POC focuses on demonstrating the vulnerability but is clean, and there's a moderate risk of malicious actors creating poisoned packages or dependencies based on the exploit code.
