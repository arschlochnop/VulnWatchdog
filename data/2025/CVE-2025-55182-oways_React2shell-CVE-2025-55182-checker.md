## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React and Next.js applications using React Server Components (RSC). This vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of data within RSC, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The provided Nuclei template (`CVE-2025-55182-react2shell.yaml`) facilitates the detection of vulnerable applications by passively identifying vulnerable version strings in various locations, including JavaScript bundles, source maps, package.json files, HTTP headers, and Next.js metadata.

The Nuclei template operates by sending a series of HTTP GET requests to common locations where version information is typically exposed. These locations include: `/_next/static/chunks/webpack.js`, `/_next/static/chunks/main.js`, `/_next/static/chunks/framework.js`, `/package.json`, `/node_modules/react-server-dom-webpack/package.json`, `/node_modules/next/package.json`, `/static/js/bundle.js.map`, `/api/version`, `/version.json`, `/static/js/main.js`, and `/dist/bundle.js`. The template then employs regular expressions and word matching to identify vulnerable versions of `react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-turbopack`, `next`, and `react`. Specifically, it searches for version strings like `"react-server-dom-webpack"[^}]{0,100}"19\.(0\.0|0|1\.0|1\.1|1|2\.0|2)"`, and similar patterns for other vulnerable packages. The template also checks for specific Next.js versions in HTTP headers, such as `Next.js 15.0.0`, `Next.js 15.0.1`, and so on.

**POC有效性分析:**
The provided POC is not an exploit in itself, but rather a passive detection mechanism. This makes it safer to use as it will not actively trigger the vulnerability. It works by identifying vulnerable versions of React and Next.js. The Nuclei template is well-structured and utilizes multiple strategies for version detection, increasing the likelihood of accurately identifying vulnerable applications. The use of regular expressions allows for flexible matching of version strings, while the inclusion of multiple file paths ensures comprehensive coverage. The template is also verified, indicating that it has been tested and confirmed to be effective.

**利用步骤:**
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request containing malicious data to a React Server Component in a vulnerable application. This malicious data would be deserialized by the server, leading to code execution. While the provided POC does not demonstrate the exploitation process, it assists in identifying vulnerable targets. Once a vulnerable application is identified, an attacker can then attempt to exploit the vulnerability using known techniques for unsafe deserialization in React Server Components. The Wiz blog post and Akamai blog post provides detailed information about the root cause of the vulnerability and how to construct a payload. The attack is unauthenticated and remotely triggerable given a vulnerable version of the described stack is being used.

**投毒风险分析:**
Given that the provided code is a passive detection template and does not contain any malicious code, the risk of code poisoning is low, estimated at 10%. The template primarily relies on string matching and regular expressions, which are relatively safe operations. However, there is a slight risk that a malicious actor could modify the template to include code that performs unintended actions, such as exfiltrating data or attempting to exploit other vulnerabilities. The template could also potentially be modified to report false positives, leading to unnecessary security alerts. For example, a modified template could include malicious JavaScript within the regex matchers that are executed by the Nuclei engine. Additionally, if an attacker were to distribute a modified version of the template that contained malicious code, users who downloaded and used the template could be exposed to risk. The `author` field includes a link to a github page, it is possible this account could be compromised, although this is a very unlikely scenario.
