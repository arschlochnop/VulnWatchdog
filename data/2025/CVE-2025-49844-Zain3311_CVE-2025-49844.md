## 详情

CVE-2025-49844 is a critical vulnerability in Redis, a popular in-memory data structure store. It's a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability within the Lua interpreter integrated into Redis. An authenticated user with the ability to execute Lua scripts can exploit this flaw to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the Redis server. The vulnerability arises because the Lua scripting engine may continue to reference memory after it has been freed, leading to memory corruption and potentially allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code. 

The provided search results confirm the existence and severity of CVE-2025-49844. Several sources, including security advisories and vulnerability databases, highlight the RCE nature of the vulnerability and its critical CVSS score of 10.0. The GitHub repository "raminfp/redis_exploit" (RediShell) indicates the availability of a public exploit. Universities and security firms actively are posting about this vulnerability. The exploit itself leverages the Lua scripting capabilities of Redis to trigger the use-after-free condition. The attacker crafts a malicious Lua script that manipulates memory in a way that causes the Redis server to access freed memory. Through careful manipulation, the attacker can overwrite critical data structures or inject malicious code into the server's memory space. When the server attempts to use the corrupted data or execute the injected code, it effectively grants the attacker control over the system. The Microsoft Q&A entry indicates Azure Cache for Redis is potentially vulnerable.

Based on the search result the attack vector requires authentication to the Redis instance, so the attacker needs to have valid credentials. The POC identified as DesiShop, which is a .NET project, is unrelated and represents a false positive. This highlights the importance of carefully analyzing POCs to ensure they actually target the reported vulnerability. The RediShell exploit appears more likely to be a relevant and working exploit.

The risk of code poisoning associated with this vulnerability is moderate. While the core exploit leverages a known UAF vulnerability in Redis's Lua interpreter, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the Lua scripts used to exploit the vulnerability. However, due to the relatively self-contained nature of Lua scripting within Redis and the fact that the primary goal is to achieve RCE directly on the Redis server, the risk of widespread code poisoning is lower compared to vulnerabilities in web applications or other systems where external dependencies are more prevalent. Because the POC relies on Lua scripting a malicious actor may inject a script to cause denial of service. However this is less likely as the primary attack vector will be RCE.
