## 详情

CVE-2025-49844 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting Redis versions 8.2.1 and below. The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error that can be triggered by a specially crafted Lua script. An authenticated user can manipulate the garbage collector via Lua scripting, leading to the use-after-free condition and potential remote code execution. According to the search results, this issue exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting enabled. Redis suggests restricting network access to minimize the risk of exploitation. Exploitation requires an attacker to gain authenticated access to the Redis instance. Sysdig's blog post describes this vulnerability as "RediShell" and highlights its severity due to the high CVSS score of 10.0, emphasizing the need for quick remediation. However, the provided POC code refers to a completely different project called "DesiShop", which is a .NET web application and is irrelevant to the Redis vulnerability. The DesiShop project appears to be a basic web application built with .NET 5.0, utilizing standard libraries and components such as Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer and Swashbuckle.AspNetCore. There are no apparent signs of vulnerability in the DesiShop code, further indicating the disconnect between the POC and the CVE. Due to the lack of a functional POC for CVE-2025-49844, the effectiveness of the exploit cannot be directly verified. However, based on the vulnerability description and the CVSS score, a successful exploit could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, or denial of service. 

Regarding the投毒风险, the provided POC code for DesiShop does not contain any obvious malicious code or backdoors. It primarily consists of standard .NET web application code with typical configurations and dependencies. However, since the provided code is unrelated to the Redis vulnerability, the analysis of its投毒风险is inherently irrelevant to CVE-2025-49844. The DesiShop project contains configurations and dependencies on packages like JWT Bearer Authentication. While these are not inherently malicious, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in these components could potentially be exploited. The code does not contain any external script execution or eval functions, which reduces the likelihood of arbitrary code execution. The overall structure and content of the provided code suggest a relatively low投毒风险in the context of the DesiShop project. Therefore, based on the available information, the投毒风险is estimated to be around 10%. This low risk is due to the fact that the provided code doesn't relate to the actual vulnerability and appears to be benign.
