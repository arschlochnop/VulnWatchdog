## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components (RSC). The vulnerability stems from the deserialization process within React Flight Client, potentially impacting Next.js applications leveraging RSC. The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates various exploit methods, including stdout redirection via HTTP 303, HTTP 500 errors, and blind exploitation. Furthermore, the POC includes scripts for enumerating action IDs, URL-encoded exploitation for WAF bypass, and HTTP 200 stealth exploitation. The most concerning aspect is the availability of an interactive shell, enabling attackers to execute commands, download files, and traverse the file system.

The POC effectively showcases the vulnerability with multiple exploit scripts: `exploit-redirect.sh`, `exploit-throw.sh`, `exploit-blind.sh`, `enumerate-actions.sh`, `exploit-urlencoded.sh`, `exploit-reflect.sh`, `shell.sh`, and `exfil-file.sh`. The `shell.sh` script provides an interactive shell over RCE, allowing for advanced exploitation. The `exfil-file.sh` script facilitates file exfiltration, automatically chunking large files to bypass header size limitations. The presence of a detection script (`detect.sh`) simplifies vulnerability assessment.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would typically follow these steps: 1. Start the vulnerable server using `pnpm dev` or `NODE_ENV=production pnpm build && pnpm start`. 2. Use `detect.sh` to verify the presence of the vulnerability. 3. Enumerate action IDs using `enumerate-actions.sh`. 4. Execute commands using `exploit-redirect.sh` or `exploit-throw.sh`. 5. For stealthier attacks, utilize `exploit-reflect.sh` with a valid action ID. 6. Establish an interactive shell with `shell.sh` for complete control. 7. Exfiltrate sensitive files using `exfil-file.sh`.

The投毒risk analysis reveals a moderate risk level of 30%. While the provided code is relatively clean and well-documented, the use of `eval` or similar dynamic code execution techniques within the exploited server components (not within the provided scripts themselves) could introduce opportunities for code injection and backdoors. If an attacker were to successfully compromise the server and inject malicious code into the server-side React components, this could lead to persistent and difficult-to-detect compromises. Also, the exfiltration scripts could be modified to exfiltrate not just data but malicious code, contributing to code poisoning. The scripts themselves use standard libraries and lack obfuscation, but the nature of RCE vulnerabilities always presents the potential for attackers to introduce malicious elements into the target environment. The provided scripts do not contain any direct signs of code poisoning, but the interactive shell capability amplifies the attack surface, enabling the attacker to introduce poisoned code after successful exploitation. The vulnerability itself is more of a concern than the POC.
