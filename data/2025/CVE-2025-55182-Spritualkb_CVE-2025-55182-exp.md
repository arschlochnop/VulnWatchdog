## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability affecting React Server Components and Next.js. The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of user input within React Server Components. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted payload to a vulnerable React Server Function endpoint. The payload, when deserialized, allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability is pre-authentication, meaning an attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit it. The CVSS score of 10 indicates the highest level of severity, requiring immediate attention. Based on the search results, multiple security firms (Tenable, Wiz.io, Cloudflare, Vulncheck, Rapid7) have identified and are responding to this vulnerability, and some (Cloudflare) are proactively protecting against it. The provided POC code consists of a disclaimer and an empty file named "1.txt". The disclaimer explicitly prohibits unauthorized use and outlines the legal implications of exploiting the vulnerability without permission, strongly suggesting that actual exploit code exists and should be handled responsibly. The absence of actual exploit code in the provided files makes a thorough validation impossible. We can assume, based on the description, that the exploit involves crafting a malicious payload and sending it to a vulnerable endpoint. Further investigation is needed to identify the vulnerable endpoints and the structure of the malicious payload. Exploitation likely involves the attacker sending a crafted serialized object to the server. The server, upon deserializing this object, executes arbitrary code due to the inherent dangers of unsafe deserialization. To successfully exploit this, an attacker needs to identify React Server Components which are vulnerable to this attack, craft a malicious payload that, when deserialized, will execute malicious code. Then, attacker needs to send the payload to the identified vulnerable endpoint. 

**投毒风险分析:**
Given the nature of the vulnerability (unsafe deserialization leading to RCE), there's a moderate risk of code poisoning, but the provided POC code itself does not contain malicious code. The risk arises if threat actors create and distribute modified versions of the exploit that include backdoors or other malicious functionalities. Since the provided files only contains legal disclaimers, the poisoning risk is low, around 10%. The primary concern would be if an attacker distributed poisoned code that looked like an official POC, which performed additional malicious activities after triggering the initial vulnerability. This might include installing persistent backdoors, stealing sensitive data, or using the compromised server as part of a botnet. The absence of explicit malicious code in the provided files and the strong legal disclaimers significantly mitigate the immediate poisoning risk. However, users should remain vigilant when sourcing exploit code from untrusted sources and always verify its integrity before execution. Since the initial exploit occurs through the transmission of a payload, detecting and mitigating potential malicious activity could also occur at the network level.
