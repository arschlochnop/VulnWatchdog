## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React and Next.js applications. The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization in React Server Components (RSC), specifically how React's Server Functions protocol processes incoming Flight requests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted payload to a vulnerable React Server Function endpoint. The proof-of-concept (POC) code provided demonstrates the vulnerability. The provided python code sends POST requests with specifically crafted files to the server. The `files` dictionary contains the malicious payload designed to trigger the deserialization vulnerability. The `ACTION_ID` specifies the endpoint to target. The different examples in the README show different approaches to trigger errors or code execution. Example 1 uses `["$1:constructor:constructor"]` and `{"a": "b"}` to call a function. Other examples use different payloads such as `["$1"]` and `"$@"` that result in connection errors, or `["$F"]` which causes a TypeError. These various attempts indicate a high level of control over the deserialization process. The fact that error messages and even arbitrary code execution can be triggered demonstrates the severity and exploitability of the vulnerability. The POC appears to be effective and requires minimal configuration, only requiring the target URL. The vulnerability is easily exploitable with a single HTTP request, making the attack complexity low. 

**Exploitation Steps:**
1. Identify a React or Next.js application using React Server Components.
2. Determine if the application is vulnerable to CVE-2025-55182.
3. Craft a malicious payload using the techniques demonstrated in the POC code.
4. Send the payload to a vulnerable React Server Function endpoint.
5. If successful, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Poisoning Risk Analysis:**
The provided POC code contains a relatively low poisoning risk. The python code itself is clear and does not appear to contain any malicious intent beyond exploiting the known deserialization vulnerability. However, the vulnerability itself could be exploited to introduce malicious code into the targeted application. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to inject backdoors, modify application logic, or steal sensitive data. The risk is increased by the nature of deserialization vulnerabilities, which enable arbitrary object creation. The use of libraries that could be used for malicious purposes (like `os` or `subprocess` if accessible) would increase the risk. Given the nature of the exploit and the demonstrated control over the deserialization process, a poisoning risk of 40% is assigned to reflect the potential for exploiting the vulnerability to inject malicious code.
