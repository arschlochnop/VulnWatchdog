## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React and Next.js applications that utilize React Server Components (RSC). The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of data within the RSC protocol, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The core issue lies in how React's Server Functions process incoming Flight requests. Successful exploitation requires sending a specially crafted payload to a vulnerable React Server Function endpoint. While the vulnerability itself is severe, real-world exploitation in Next.js production environments is often conditional. Next.js uses a `serverManifest` to whitelist allowed modules. This manifest acts as a barrier, preventing direct loading of dangerous modules like `child_process` via RSC. Attackers often need to chain this vulnerability with a Prototype Pollution primitive to overwrite the `serverManifest` in memory and bypass the whitelist. Furthermore, in production builds, Webpack minification obfuscates module IDs (e.g., `742` instead of `vm`). This means that rigid exploits that rely on guessing module names may fail, resulting in false negatives. The provided POC code is a surface exposure scanner. It does not directly exploit the RCE vulnerability. Instead, it checks if the RSC protocol is exposed and active on a given endpoint. This is a crucial prerequisite for identifying potential attack surfaces where a Prototype Pollution chain could be attempted. The scanner looks for the `Content-Type: text/x-component` stream signature, indicating an active RSC endpoint. It is ID agnostic, meaning it doesn't need to guess the correct minified ID to detect exposure. The scanner is non-intrusive and does not attempt to execute code, making it safe for production environments. The utilization of the POC involves cloning the repository, installing the requirements, and executing the scanner script. The scanner can be used to check a single URL or a list of URLs from a file. It can also be run in insecure mode to ignore SSL/TLS certificate errors. The successful identification of an exposed endpoint warrants further investigation for potential Prototype Pollution vectors.

**投毒风险分析:**
虽然POC本身是一个无害的扫描器，但围绕CVE-2025-55182的潜在投毒风险是存在的。高风险在于，攻击者可能会创建恶意的Prototype Pollution payload，伪装成合法的库或组件，诱骗开发者安装和使用，从而实现RCE。此外，由于RSC涉及服务器端代码的执行，恶意Payload可能会尝试加载未经授权的模块或执行系统命令。 由于该POC只是一个扫描工具，相对来说投毒风险较低，但是如果攻击者利用此扫描器来定位目标，后续有可能发布针对性的恶意Payload，所以定为较低的风险级别。
考虑到POC的性质（扫描器）和目前已知的攻击链（需要结合Prototype Pollution），投毒风险评定为30%。
