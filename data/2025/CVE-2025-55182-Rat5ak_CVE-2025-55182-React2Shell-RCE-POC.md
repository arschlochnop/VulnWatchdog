## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components (RSC) and frameworks that embed the RSC Flight protocol, most notably Next.js. The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of malformed RSC/Flight payloads when handling Server Functions (Server Actions). An attacker can exploit this by sending crafted data to the server, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript code. The provided Proof of Concept (POC) clearly demonstrates the vulnerability and offers a strong foundation for understanding and reproducing the exploit.

POC有效性分析:
The provided README.md file offers a well-documented analysis of the vulnerability, outlining the affected software versions and providing clear exploitation conditions. It highlights that the core bug resides in the server-side RSC Flight implementation, affecting several npm packages and versions. The POC details the vulnerable packages (`react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-parcel`, `react-server-dom-turbopack`) and the corresponding vulnerable versions. It also correctly identifies the patched versions, allowing for precise verification of the vulnerability. The POC provides guidance on vulnerable Next.js versions that are affected when using the App Router. Default `create-next-app` projects utilizing the App Router and React 19 are also susceptible if not updated. The documentation also clearly specifies scenarios where the vulnerability is not applicable, such as Next.js Pages Router applications or stable Next.js 13 and 14 versions that do not employ the React 19 RSC stack. The POC offers a clear explanation of exploitation conditions. It indicates that a vulnerable application must be utilizing React Server Components (RSC) and Server Functions. Exploitation requires the attacker to send a malformed RSC/Flight payload, which triggers unsafe deserialization on the server, leading to code execution. The existence of dedicated documentation and the identification of exploitation conditions suggest the POC is highly reliable and can be effectively used to reproduce the vulnerability in a controlled environment.

利用步骤:
1. Identify a React application using React Server Components and vulnerable versions of `react-server-dom-*` packages or Next.js with the App Router.
2. Craft a malformed RSC/Flight payload designed to trigger unsafe deserialization.
3. Send the crafted payload to a Server Function endpoint.
4. Observe the execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript code on the server.

投毒风险分析:
The provided POC code primarily focuses on demonstrating the RCE vulnerability through unsafe deserialization. While the core vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution, the POC itself does not appear to contain overtly malicious code or backdoors that would immediately compromise a system beyond the scope of the demonstrated vulnerability. The primary risk lies in the potential for attackers to leverage the demonstrated RCE for malicious purposes once they have gained code execution. The risk of direct poisoning through the provided POC appears relatively low. The code provided in the README.md focuses on explanation and research, which reduces the immediate risk. However, there are potential risks to consider: the potential for the introduction of malicious code during the exploitation phase. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially enabling the attacker to install backdoors, steal sensitive data, or further compromise the system. Another risk lies in the possibility that an attacker could modify the POC to include malicious payloads before sharing it, thereby increasing the risk of secondary infections. Overall, the poisoning risk is estimated at 20%.
