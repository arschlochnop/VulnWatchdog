## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability affecting React Server Components and Next.js. The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of user-provided input, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The vulnerability is present in React packages `react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-parcel`, and `react-server-dom-turbopack` versions 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0, and Next.js versions 15.0.0 through 16.0.6. Exploit involves crafting a malicious payload and sending it to a vulnerable React Server Function endpoint. The server-side component deserializes this payload, leading to code execution. The provided POC includes a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml, enabling the easy setup of a vulnerable environment for testing and demonstration. The README.md file explains the vulnerability, affected versions, and patched versions, along with instructions for setting up the vulnerable environment using Podman or Docker Compose. The presence of Nuclei scanner template(CVE-2025-55182.yaml) and scan scripts(scan.sh) further increases the usability and effectiveness of the provided POC. 

To successfully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker needs to identify a React Server Function endpoint exposed by the application. Then, a specially crafted serialized payload is sent to this endpoint, leveraging the unsafe deserialization flaw. This payload can contain arbitrary code that will be executed by the server when it deserializes the payload. The attacker can gain complete control over the server, allowing them to read sensitive information, modify files, or launch further attacks on the internal network.

The POC's投毒 risk is relatively low. The provided code primarily focuses on demonstrating and exploiting the RCE vulnerability. The Dockerfile sets up a basic Node.js environment for the vulnerable application, and the docker-compose.yml file orchestrates the container setup. The scan scripts utilize Nuclei for vulnerability scanning, a well-known and trusted tool. There is no immediate evidence of malicious code or backdoors within the provided files. However, it is essential to exercise caution when using any externally sourced code, especially those related to security vulnerabilities. Always review and understand the code before deploying or running it in any environment. If the attacker modifies the original exploit code to include malicious functionality, such as downloading and executing arbitrary scripts or establishing a reverse shell, the poisoning risk would significantly increase. Therefore, users should always verify the integrity of the downloaded code and dependencies, and regularly scan their systems for any signs of compromise.
