## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical pre-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server without any prior authentication. The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how React decodes payloads sent to Server Function endpoints. Specifically, the affected packages include `react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-parcel`, and `react-server-dom-turbopack` versions 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0. Frameworks such as Next.js, React Router (RSC APIs), Waku, Parcel RSC (`@parcel/rsc`), Vite RSC (`@vitejs/plugin-rsc`), and Redwood SDK (`rwsdk`) are also affected if they use the vulnerable React packages.

The provided POC is a scanner written in Go that quickly identifies vulnerable targets. The scanner can be used against a single target URL or a list of URLs from a file. It also supports custom endpoints, output to JSON, and various authentication methods. The POC’s README provides clear instructions on how to build and use the scanner, making it easily accessible for security researchers and developers. The exploit takes advantage of the React Server Functions allowing the client to call server-side functions. React converts client requests to HTTP requests, which are then vulnerable to the exploit.

The exploitation steps generally involve sending a specially crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable React Server Function endpoint. This request contains a malicious payload that, when decoded by the server, leads to arbitrary code execution. The exact steps may vary depending on the specific implementation of the React application and the server-side environment. It involves sending a crafted payload through the React Server Component's endpoint, triggering the vulnerability during the decoding process on the server-side. This results in remote code execution without requiring any prior authentication, posing a significant threat to affected systems.

The poisoning risk associated with this vulnerability is relatively low. The provided scanner code is written in Go and consists primarily of network requests and JSON parsing. There is no evidence of code obfuscation or attempts to inject malicious code into the scanned systems. The scanner itself does not execute any code on the target system; it only checks for the presence of the vulnerability. However, a modified scanner could be created to deliver a malicious payload, so users should only use scanners from trusted sources. The risk primarily comes from potential modifications of the scanner itself to include malicious code or exfiltrate data, but the current implementation appears safe, resulting in a poisoning risk assessment of 15%.
