## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js applications. The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization within React Server Components, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The provided POC code demonstrates a readily usable exploit that allows for command execution, memory injection (webshell), and reverse shell capabilities. The POC provides a GUI interface and supports multiple attack modes, including command execution with result feedback, in-memory webshell injection, and reverse shell establishment. It supports HTTP proxy configuration and custom headers to bypass simple protections. The tool's effectiveness is high given its capacity to perform all described exploitation steps reliably. The README.md file describes the vulnerable versions of React and Next.js, and also lists other affected components like Dify and NextChat. 

**Exploitation Steps:**
1. Configure the target URL and attack path in the tool's interface.
2. Test the vulnerability using the "测试漏洞" button to confirm its existence.
3. Choose the desired attack mode: Command Execution, Memory Injection, or Reverse Shell.
4. For Command Execution, enter the command to execute and click "执行命令". The output will be displayed.
5. For Memory Injection, set the access path and click "注入内存马". Then, access the URL to execute commands.
6. For Reverse Shell, start a listener on your machine, enter the listening IP and port in the tool, and click "发送反弹Shell".

**投毒风险分析:**
The provided tool, while effective for exploiting CVE-2025-55182, presents a moderate risk of being weaponized with malicious payloads or features. The tool is a compiled JAR file, obfuscating the underlying code and increasing the difficulty of identifying potential malicious code added by attackers. The fact that the tool provides memory injection capabilities increases the risk, as an attacker could easily add malicious webshell injection to the existing functionality. Furthermore, the tool could be repackaged with embedded malware designed to compromise the attacker's system or network during usage. The tool connects to external resources when checking for updates, creating an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack to deliver a compromised version. Due to these reasons, the poisoning risk is moderate, estimated at 35%. Users should exercise caution and only use the tool in controlled environments, ensuring they obtain it from a trustworthy source and verify its integrity before use.
