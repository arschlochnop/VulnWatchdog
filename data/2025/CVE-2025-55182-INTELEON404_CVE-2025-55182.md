## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js App Router, dubbed React2Shell. The vulnerability stems from an unsafe deserialization in how React's Server Functions protocol processes incoming Flight requests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a specially crafted payload to a vulnerable React Server Function endpoint. The vulnerability chain allows for full remote code execution on the server with a single crafted HTTP POST request using the RSC “Flight” protocol, requiring no user interaction, authentication, or CSRF tokens.

The POC provided is a research and defence reference document. It details the technical root cause, affected software versions, and provides a high-fidelity detection signature. The signature triggers a deterministic deserialization crash without executing any attacker code, useful for detection and prevention. The vulnerability involves prototype pollution via `$<id>:__proto__:then`, forced resolution of a malicious model chunk as a Promise, hijacking of internal `_formData.get` → `Function.constructor`, injection of arbitrary JavaScript into `_prefix` field, and final execution via `process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync(...)`.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker sends a POST request with a multipart/form-data payload. This payload is deserialized using `JSON.parse` with custom reviver logic. The reviver incorrectly trusts user-controlled keys, leading to the exploitation chain described above. Successful exploitation results in arbitrary code execution on the server.

The poisoning risk is low because the provided POC doesn't include any weaponized exploit code. It focuses on technical analysis, detection signatures, timelines, and official references. The provided detection signature causes a crash, but does not execute arbitrary code. While the vulnerability itself could be exploited to deliver malicious payloads, the provided POC doesn't contain such payloads. The risk mainly arises from potential modifications or adaptations of the POC that could introduce malicious code. The core vulnerability lies in the deserialization process, where attacker-controlled keys are incorrectly trusted. However, the specific POC provided is more focused on detection and understanding the vulnerability than on active exploitation.
