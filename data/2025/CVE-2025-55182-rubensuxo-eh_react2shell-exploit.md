## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability affecting React Server Components. Specifically, it targets versions 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0, including packages like react-server-dom-parcel, react-server-dom-turbopack, and react-server-dom-webpack. The vulnerability, dubbed React2Shell, stems from unsafe deserialization in React Server Components (RSC). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted payload to a vulnerable React Server Function endpoint, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. 

The provided POC, React2Shell-Exploit-Kensei, is a comprehensive toolkit designed to facilitate the exploitation of this vulnerability. It includes a Python exploit script with automated and manual modes, a Docker-based vulnerable lab environment utilizing Next.js 16.0.6, Burp Suite exploitation templates, and Nuclei detection template. The exploit allows for command execution, file reading, and even spawning an interactive shell on the target server. The provided examples demonstrate various usage scenarios, including scanning for vulnerable endpoints, executing arbitrary commands, reading files, and bypassing Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). The Docker environment provides a readily available target for testing and development purposes. The Burp Suite and Nuclei templates aid in identifying and exploiting the vulnerability in real-world applications.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would typically identify a React Server Function endpoint within a target application. They would then craft a malicious payload designed to trigger the unsafe deserialization. This payload is then sent to the vulnerable endpoint, potentially leading to code execution on the server. The POC automates this process, making it easier for both security researchers and malicious actors to exploit the vulnerability. The existence of a functional exploit significantly increases the risk associated with CVE-2025-55182.

Regarding poisoning risk, the provided exploit code appears relatively clean and well-documented. It primarily utilizes standard Python libraries and doesn't exhibit any obvious signs of malicious intent, such as obfuscation or the inclusion of external dependencies from untrusted sources. However, as with any publicly available exploit code, there is always a potential risk of it being modified or repackaged with malicious payloads. The risk is assessed as low since the code base is easy to inspect, and the attack doesn't require complex dependencies. The reliance on standard libraries minimizes the attack surface for introducing malicious code. Therefore, a poisoning risk of 15% is assigned.
