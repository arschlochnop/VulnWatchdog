## 详情

CVE-2025-59287 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). The vulnerability is due to unsafe deserialization. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the WSUS server, leading to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. The provided POC code (CVE-2025-59287-Sigma-Rule) on Github suggests a Sigma rule under development, indicating active research and potential exploitation in the wild. The HawkTrace advisory further confirms the unsafe deserialization issue. The provided links show that the vulnerability is actively discussed and exploited. The POC likely involves crafting a malicious object that, when deserialized by WSUS, triggers code execution. The vulnerability exists because WSUS doesn't properly validate the data being deserialized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. The exploitation steps would likely involve: 1. Identifying a WSUS server; 2. Crafting a malicious serialized object; 3. Sending the object to the WSUS server; 4. Triggering the deserialization process; 5. Achieving remote code execution. A functional PoC probably involves sending a specially crafted SOAP request to the WSUS server that exploits the deserialization vulnerability. The attacker would need to identify an endpoint that handles deserialization and then craft a malicious payload to exploit it. The successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to completely compromise the WSUS server, potentially leading to the deployment of malicious updates to client machines. This can have devastating consequences, especially in large organizations that rely on WSUS for patch management. 

The投毒风险分析：While the provided POC seems to be focused on detection rules, there's a moderate risk of code poisoning. The risk is not high (say over 70%) as the available information is quite specific to the vulnerability. Someone may craft a slightly modified, yet malicious, exploit and replace the original one. The risk comes primarily from the possibility of a modified PoC containing a reverse shell, keylogger or an automatic propagation mechanism to infect other systems or steal credentials. The Sigma rule, once created, can be poisoned to either have false positives, causing denial of service, or false negatives, allowing the attacker to compromise the system without being detected. Further analysis is needed to evaluate the risk completely. However, there is no evidence of obfuscation in the available PoC code, suggesting a low to medium risk (40%).
