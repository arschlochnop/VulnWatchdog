## 详情

CVE-2025-55182 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js applications. This vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization within the Flight protocol, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted payload to a vulnerable React Server Function endpoint. The vulnerability is present in React versions 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0, as well as Next.js versions >=14.3.0-canary.77, and all 15.x and 16.x releases prior to the application of patches. Exploitation is straightforward, requiring only the ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable endpoint. The provided POC is a scanner that checks for the presence of this vulnerability, including integration templates for common security tools such as Nuclei, Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP, simplifying the detection and exploitation of the vulnerability across a wide range of applications. The scanner provides JSON output, can read multiple URLs from a file and also has flags for verbose output, timeout configuration and custom User-Agent. 

**Exploitation Steps:**
1.  Identify a React or Next.js application utilizing React Server Components.
2.  Determine the application's version to confirm vulnerability.
3.  Use the provided scanner to detect vulnerable endpoints.
4.  Craft a malicious payload targeting the insecure deserialization.
5.  Send the payload to the vulnerable endpoint to trigger remote code execution.

**POC Validity Analysis:** The provided POC is a well-documented vulnerability scanner with clear instructions for usage and integration with existing security tools. The existence of Nuclei, Burp Suite, and OWASP ZAP templates suggests that the POC has been validated by multiple researchers and is considered reliable. The `TECHNICAL.md` file provides in-depth analysis of the vulnerability, further enhancing confidence in the POC's effectiveness.

**投毒风险分析:** The primary function of the provided code is to scan for the CVE-2025-55182 vulnerability. While the scanner itself doesn't contain malicious code, the potential for misuse exists. An attacker could modify the scanner to include malicious payloads or to exfiltrate sensitive information from targeted systems. The `cve-2025-55182-check.sh` script primarily uses `curl` which can be used to inject malicious code. The risk is relatively low (estimated at 15%) due to the transparency of the code and reliance on standard command-line tools. There are no external scripts being pulled. The script does offer the ability to specify a custom User-Agent string, which could potentially be abused for obfuscation or to mask malicious activity. However, the risk is considered low because the code itself is readable and does not contain any explicitly harmful actions.
