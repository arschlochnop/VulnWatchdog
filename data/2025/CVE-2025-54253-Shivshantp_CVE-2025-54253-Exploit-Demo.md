## 详情

CVE-2025-54253 represents a critical OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) injection vulnerability specifically impacting Adobe AEM Forms on JEE, affecting all versions up to and including 6.5.23.0. This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by injecting malicious OGNL expressions into the `/adminui/debug` endpoint. OGNL is a powerful expression language used in Java applications, and its improper handling can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, including direct command execution on the underlying operating system. The core of this vulnerability lies in an exposed debugging interface that, without proper authentication or input sanitization, evaluates user-controlled input as OGNL expressions. This allows attackers to bypass intended security controls and execute arbitrary operating system commands under the privileges of the application server. With a pending CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical), this vulnerability poses an extremely high risk, as it permits full system compromise from a remote, unauthenticated attacker. The immediate availability of a functional Proof of Concept (PoC) further amplifies the urgency for affected organizations to implement mitigation strategies.

**POC有效性分析:**
The provided Proof of Concept is exceptionally well-structured, comprehensive, and highly effective in demonstrating the exploitability of CVE-2025-54253. It includes multiple vectors for exploitation: direct HTTP requests via `curl` or web browser for simple command execution, and a dedicated Python script (`cve-2025-54253-poc.py`) for automated and potentially more complex interactions. The PoC documentation is robust, featuring clear instructions, command examples (e.g., `curl "http://localhost:4502/adminui/debug?debug=OGNL:whoami"`), and even screenshots illustrating successful command execution outputs (such as `id`, `uname -a`, and `ls -la`). The inclusion of sample exploit logs and a mention of a Flask server for local simulation further enhances its verifiability and ease of reproduction for defensive security researchers. The PoC explicitly confirms "Confined exploitability" and carries a "Verified" badge, indicating that it has undergone testing and is proven to work. This high quality of the PoC means that any security team can quickly replicate the vulnerability and confirm their exposure, making it an invaluable tool for vulnerability assessment and patching efforts. The documented output clearly shows arbitrary command execution, providing irrefutable evidence of the RCE capability.

**利用步骤:**
1.  **Identify Target:** Locate an Adobe AEM Forms on JEE instance running a vulnerable version (<= 6.5.23.0).
2.  **Endpoint Accessibility Check:** Confirm that the `/adminui/debug` endpoint is exposed and accessible from the attacker's network without requiring authentication. This is a crucial prerequisite for exploitation.
3.  **Direct HTTP Exploitation (Example with `curl`):**
    *   Open a terminal or command prompt.
    *   Craft an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint, embedding the desired operating system command within an OGNL expression in the `debug` parameter.
    *   Example from PoC: `curl "http://[TARGET_HOST]:[PORT]/adminui/debug?debug=OGNL:whoami"`. Replace `[TARGET_HOST]` and `[PORT]` with the actual target's address and port.
    *   Observe the HTTP response body for the output of the executed command, which confirms successful RCE.
4.  **Automated Exploitation (Using PoC Script):**
    *   Download or create the `cve-2025-54253-poc.py` script (assuming it follows the behavior described in the `README`).
    *   Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed on the attacking machine.
    *   Execute the script, providing the target URL and the command to be executed: `python3 cve-2025-54253-poc.py --url http://[TARGET_HOST]:[PORT] --cmd "id"`. Replace `[TARGET_HOST]` and `[PORT]` accordingly.
    *   The script will handle sending the OGNL payload and parsing the response.
    *   Review the script's console output or the generated `exploit.log` file for the command's execution result.
These steps clearly illustrate how an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain remote control over affected Adobe AEM Forms on JEE instances.

**投毒风险分析:**
The poisoning risk associated with this specific public Proof of Concept (PoC) document, based on the provided input, is categorized as **low (10%)**. This assessment is primarily due to the transparency and clarity of the `README.md` file. The document explicitly describes a legitimate vulnerability (OGNL injection leading to RCE), outlines the technical details, and provides direct, non-obfuscated examples of how to exploit it. The showcased commands (`whoami`, `id`, `uname -a`, `ls -la`) are standard, benign commands commonly used by security researchers to verify command execution capabilities without causing harm. There is no indication within the provided text of embedded malicious code, obfuscated payloads, or attempts to download or execute external untrusted scripts from suspicious sources. The Python script mentioned, while its source code is not provided, is described in a way that suggests it automates the legitimate vulnerability testing process (e.g., `--cmd "whoami"`).

However, it is crucial to understand that while the *PoC itself* appears clean, the *nature of the vulnerability* it exploits (unauthenticated RCE) poses an extremely high risk for weaponization. The public availability of a functional and well-documented RCE PoC significantly lowers the barrier for less skilled attackers to target vulnerable Adobe AEM Forms on JEE instances. Malicious actors could easily adapt the provided `curl` command or modify the Python script to:
1.  **Establish Persistent Access:** Execute commands to create new user accounts, install SSH keys, or deploy web shells/backdoors.
2.  **Data Exfiltration:** Run commands to locate and extract sensitive configuration files, databases, or user data.
3.  **Lateral Movement:** Utilize the compromised server as a pivot point to attack other internal systems within the network.
4.  **Cryptomining/Botnet Integration:** Install cryptocurrency miners or join the server to a botnet for DDoS attacks.
5.  **Defacement/Denial of Service:** Alter website content or introduce mechanisms to render the service unavailable.
Therefore, while the PoC for defensive research is not poisoned, organizations must act with extreme urgency. The ease of exploitation (remote, unauthenticated, low complexity) combined with a critical CVSS score means that vulnerable systems are prime targets for opportunistic attacks. Continuous monitoring for suspicious OGNL expressions in logs, immediate application of vendor patches, and strict access control to `/adminui/debug` are paramount to mitigate the severe threat posed by the underlying vulnerability, irrespective of the PoC's benign nature. The risk of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild is extremely high, even if the provided PoC is clean.
